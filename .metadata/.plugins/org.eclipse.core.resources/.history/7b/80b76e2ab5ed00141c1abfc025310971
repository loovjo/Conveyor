Is a hello world program in Conveyor.

O: The executor

>,<,#,=,T: Ground.
>: Move to the right
<: Move to the left
=: Continue to move in the direction that it was last in.
#: Go down if top element is 0
T: Skip next command and continue moving in the same direction as before.

": Start/stop parsing string
0-9: Put that number on the stack
F: A furnace. the program ends when the executor gets here.
.: Print the ascii-value of the top stack element. The element gets removed from the stack.
,: Same as ., but instead of printing ascii, we print the actual number.
:: Duplicate top stack element.
P: Pop top element.
^: Elevator. Go one char upwards.
+,-,*,/: Pop two numbers, a and b and preform the selected action. (Example program: 25*5/, = (2 * 5) / 5)
x; Pop two values, a and b, and push a^b.
?: Pop a value and push a random number between 0 (inclusive) and the popped value (exclusive).
G: Pop a value, n, and push the n'th value from the stack.
\: Swap the top two values.
@: Swap the top three values.
(: Decrement the top value.
): Increment the top value.
S: Pop a value, sleep for that amount of milliseconds.
p: Pop three values, c, y and x. Replace the character at x, y in the program with the ascii value of c.
a: Pop two values, y and x and push the ascii value in the program at x, y to the stack.
i: If the buffer is empty, read a line from STDIN and push it to the buffer. After that, push the last char on the buffer to the stack.
I: The same as i except it pushes the first character from the buffer the stack.
